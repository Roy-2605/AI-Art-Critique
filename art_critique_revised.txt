In revising the critique to focus on the narrative conveyed through the composition, one can delve deeper into how Michelangelo employs various compositional strategies to enhance the storytelling within the Last Judgment fresco.

Narrative Through Composition:
Michelangelo's composition is not only a marvel of dynamism but also a carefully structured narrative device. At the center, Christ's commanding presence as the Judge acts as the fulcrum of the entire narrative. The positioning of Christ is not arbitrarily central; it’s symbolically resonant – the ultimate arbiter deciding the fates of all souls depicted. His figure creates a visual axis, as the saved souls rise toward him on his right side, while the damned descend on his left, underscoring the stark dichotomy of afterlife destinations.

Surrounding Christ, the saints, martyrs, and figures from Christian theology form an organized chaos. This vast array of characters is not just a show of Michelangelo's ability to represent the human form but also a visual recounting of sacred history that contributes to the story of Judgment Day. Each saint, for instance, is identifiable by their attributes, carrying the instruments of their martyrdom, which in turn narrates their own sacrifice and eventual triumph in being close to Christ.

The lower regions of the fresco pulse with a different energy; the dead rise from their graves, expressing Michelangelo's narrative of resurrection and reckoning. Here, the composition turns tumultuous, with figures intertwining in a claustrophobic dance of fate. This density is intentional, creating a visual representation of suffering and despair contrasted starkly with the tranquility and order of the blessed above. The damned are not merely scattered; their arrangement in downward spirals and falling postures guide the eye to the hellish scenes below, completing the narrative loop of cause and consequence.

Dynamic Diagonals and Triangular Structures:
Michelangelo also uses dynamic diagonals and triangular structures, not just as compositional elements, but narrative ones. These create sub-stories within the larger Judgment narrative – groups of figures form mini vignettes that reinforce the overarching message of salvation versus damnation. The diagonals give a sense of directional force, leading the viewer’s eye in the trajectory of the chosen or the damned, enhancing the narrative flow within the chaos.

Overall, Michelangelo’s composition in the Last Judgment serves not only to fascinate and move the viewer's eye through its grandeur and complexity but also to draw them into a cohesive, structured story of the final judgment – a narrative encapsulated in paint and plaster, compelling the viewer to read and interpret the multitude of individual stories that build the larger narrative arc.

Strengths Revised:
- The composition is a narrative engine, driving the story of salvation and damnation through dynamic structuring.
- Use of symbolic positioning and identification through saints’ attributes aids in visual storytelling.
- The strategic use of crowdedness and negative space contrasts the divine order with human chaos, enhancing the narrative.

Weaknesses Revised:
- For newer audiences or those unfamiliar with Christian iconography, the crowded composition may obscure individual storylines and symbols, requiring guidance or additional knowledge to fully grasp the intricate narrative woven by Michelangelo.
